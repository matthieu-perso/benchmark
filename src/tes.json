This is an important detail that should have been included in the previous message.\nWhile the specific details of Perry's death are still unknown, it's possible that he could have been using drugs or alcohol in the hot tub before he was found. This could have led to a loss of consciousness or a medical emergency.\nAdditionally, the combination of hot water and high temperatures can increase the effects of certain drugs, making it even more dangerous to use them in this environment.\nUltimately, until the official cause of death is released by the authorities, we can only speculate on the specific circumstances surrounding Perry's death.
